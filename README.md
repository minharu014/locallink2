## ⚙️ Installation

To get started with Localink, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/localink.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```sh
   cd localink
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the development server:**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Guidelines

### 📦 Component-based Structure

Localink emphasizes a component-based architecture. Here are some key components you will work with:

- **Button Component**

- **PricingCard Component**

### 🎨 Styling with TailwindCSS

All styles are managed using TailwindCSS. You can customize your design by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file and the styles in `src/index.css`.

### 🖼️ Using Lucide Icons

Lucide icons are used across the application for visual elements. Here’s an example of how to include an icon:

```jsx
import { IconName } from "lucide-react";

const IconComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <IconName className="icon-class" />
  </div>
);

export default IconComponent;
```

## 💡 What to Do

### 1. Make it More Component-based

Ensure that you create reusable components for different parts of the webpage, such as:

- **Buttons**: Standardize button styles and interactions.
- **Pricing Cards**: Use a consistent design for displaying pricing information.

### 2. Make Buttons Work

Ensure that all buttons have their `onClick` events properly set up to handle user interactions.

## 📝 Conclusion

This documentation provides a basic outline to get started with the Localink project. For more detailed information, please refer to the comments within the code and additional project-specific documentation.
